# derive-ops
This is a practice project where I attempt to create derive macros for common math operations like add, multiply, etc. If you'd like to use something like this, I'd suggest using [derive-more](https://docs.rs/derive-more).

I'm also using this to practice using CI and setting up a project in general.
